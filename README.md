I have found a Raspberry Pi 3 + a camera can make a decent monitor for Pets (ie: is the dog eating your shoes when you are in another room).

This is a simple script to get a base install of stretch to be set up with motion. It only configures the basic settings for publishing a video stream.

Usage:

```shell

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lshannon/pi-motion-setup/master/setup.sh
chmod +x setup.sh
sudo ./setup.sh

```
No support is offered for this configuration. Use at your own risk.
